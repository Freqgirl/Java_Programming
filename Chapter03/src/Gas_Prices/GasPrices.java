 * When gasoline is $100 per barrel, then the consumerâ€™s price at the pump is between $3.50
 * and $4.00 per gallon. Create a class named GasPrices. Its main() method holds an integer
 * variable named pricePerBarrel to which you will assign a value entered by a user at the
 * keyboard.
 * Create a method to which you pass pricePerBarrel. The method displays the range of possible
 * prices per gallon. For example, if gas is $120 per barrel, then the price at the pump should
 * be between $4.20 and $4.80. Save the application as GasPrices.java.
