 * Create a class named TestBankAccount whose main() method declares four BankAccount objects. Call a getData()
 * method three times.
 * Within the method, prompt a user for values for each field for a BankAccount,
 * and return a
 * BankAccount object to the main() method where it is assigned to one of main()â€™s BankAccount  objects. Do not
 * prompt the user for values for the fourth BankAccount object, but let it continue to hold the default values.
 * Then, in main(), pass each BankAccount object in turn to a showValues() method that displays the data, calls
 * the method that deducts the monthly fee, and displays the balance again. The showValues() method also calls
 * the method that explains the deduction policy. Save the  application as TestBankAccount.java.
