 * Create a constructor for the Student class you created. The constructor should initialize each Studentâ€™s ID number
 * to 9999, his or her points earned to 12, and credit hours to 3 (resulting in a grade point average of 4.0).
 * Write a program that demonstrates that the constructor works by instantiating an object and displaying the initial
 * values. Save the application as ShowStudent2.java.
