 * Create a class for Shutterbugâ€™s Camera Store, which is having a digital camera
 * sale. The class is named DigitalCamera, and it contains data fields for a brand,
 * the number of megapixels in the resolution, and price. Include a constructor that
 * takes arguments for the brand and megapixels. If the megapixel parameter is
 * greater than 10, the constructor sets it to 10. The sale price is set based on the
 * resolution; any camera with 6 megapixels or fewer is $99, and all other cameras
 * are $129. Also include a method that displays DigitalCamera details. Save the file
 * as DigitalCamera.java
