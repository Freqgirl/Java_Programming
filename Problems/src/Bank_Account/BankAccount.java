 * Create a class named BankAccount with fields that hold an account number, the ownerâ€™s name, and the account
 * balance. Include a constructor that initializes each field to appropriate default values. Also include methods to
 * get and set each of the fields. Include a method named deductMonthlyFee() that reduces the balance by $4.00.
 * Include a static method named explainAccountPolicy() that explains that the $4 service fee will be deducted
 * each month. Save the class as BankAccount.java.
