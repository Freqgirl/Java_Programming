/**

 * Project: Java Programming
 * Package: State
 * File: State
 * Create a class named State that holds the following fields: a String for the
 * name of the state, an integer for the population, and two City objects that hold
 * data about the capital city and the most populous city. The State constructor
 * requires six parameters that represent the names and populations of the state,
 * its capital, and its most populous city. Provide get methods for each field.
 * Create the City class to be a nonstatic, private inner class within the State
 * class; the City class contains a cityâ€™s name and population. Create a class to
 * assign values to and display values from two State objects. Save the files as
 * State.java and TestState.java.
