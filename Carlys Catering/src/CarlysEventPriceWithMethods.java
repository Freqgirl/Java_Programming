 * File:  CarlysEventPrice
 * Carlyâ€™s Catering provides meals for parties and special events. In Chapter 2,
 * you wrote an application that prompts the user for the number of guests
 * attending an event, displays the company motto with a border, and then
 * displays the price of the event and whether the event is a large one. Now
 * modify the program so that the main() method contains only three executable
 * statements that each call a method as follows:
 * 1. The first executable statement calls a public static int method that
 * prompts the user for the number of guests and returns the value to the
 * main() method.
 * 2. The second executable statement calls a public static void method that
 * displays the company motto with the border.
 * 3. The last executable statement passes the number of guests to a public
 * static void method that computes the price of the event, displays the
 * price, and displays whether the event is a large event.
