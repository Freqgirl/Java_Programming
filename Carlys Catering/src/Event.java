 * Created by Kimberly Henry <kimberly.henry@outlook.com>
 * On:  Jul at: 6:34 PM.
 * Project: Carlys Catering
 * Package: PACKAGE_NAME
 * File:  Event
 * Create a class to hold Event data for Carlyâ€™s Catering. The class contains:
 * 1. Two public final static fields that hold the price per guest ($35) and the
 * cutoff value for a large event (50 guests)
 * 2. Three private fields that hold an event number, number of guests for the
 * event, and the price. The event number is stored as a String because Carly
 * plans to assign event numbers such as M312.
 * 3. Two public set methods that set the event number (setEventNumber()) and
 * the number of guests (setGuests()). The price does not have a set method
 * because the setGuests() method will calculate the price as the number of
 * guests multiplied by the price per guest every time the number of guests is set.
 * 4. Three public get methods that return the values in the three non-static fields
 * Save the file as Event.java.

This code doesn't work at all.  It isn't even written properly.  Plus, it does nothing.
