 * Create a class named Sandwich. Include a Bread field and a SandwichFilling
 * field. Include a constructor that takes parameters for each field needed in the two
 * objects and assigns them to each objectâ€™s constructor. Write an application
 * named TestSandwich to instantiate three Sandwich objects with different values,
 * and then display all the data for each object, including the total calories in a
 * Sandwich, assuming that each Sandwich is made using two slices of Bread. Save
 * both the Sandwich.java and TestSandwich.java files.
